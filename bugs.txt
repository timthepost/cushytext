A list of known bugs, by feature:

# everywhere

Code highlighting isn't working with MDX/SSX yet. I expect this to 
be fixed before Lume3 comes out (it's Lume that has to change it)

# blog

It's not possible to pipe through 'mdx' in lume filters, just 'md', 
so excerpts may contain unparsed JSX. Not much I can do about that yet.

TOC plugin for Lume currently does not work with MDX. Need to use one 
of the remark plugins, or make one.

Blog needs actual container / image styles (currently has an image
helper you have to use manually)

# documentation

# nav

I hope to see nav become more componentized. Right now there's code that
fills the sidebars automatically, and the archives and stuff, and the 
top nav, but it's all separate code. Not really a bug, it just bothers 
me a bit how it is.
