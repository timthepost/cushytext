# A Port of Infima Over to Lume + Vento

This is a theme for Lume built on Infima CSS, the same
styles that Docusaurus uses. This is not an attempt to
be Docusaurus, but rather make Infima available to 
anyone that works with content-heavy sites.

Currently awaiting the general availability of Lume3 
before continuing dev work.

Clone the repo and type `deno task dev` to poke around.

A roadmap and list of goals / etc is on the front page.
