# A Port of Infima Over to Lume + Vento

This is a theme for Lume built on Infima CSS, the same
styles that Docusaurus uses. This is not an attempt to
be Docusaurus, but rather make Infima available to 
anyone that works with content-heavy sites with Lume.

Infima was devekioped by Meta in the process of coming
up with a framework that suits the needs of developers,
documentarians and even product managers. It's not as
modern as things like Tailwind, but it's extremely easy
to use and extremely flexible when it comes to laying 
out lots and lots of text.

## Status:

Currently awaiting the general availability of Lume3 
before continuing dev work. Infima has been installed
and templated, theming works great, docs blog and pages
have been prototyped, but components are going to take 
a while, as will making navigation "just work". 

## Contributing

Clone the repo and type `deno task dev` to poke around.

A roadmap and list of goals / etc is on the [front page](src/index.mdx).

I'm at `timthepost@protonmail.com` if you want to
collaborate.
