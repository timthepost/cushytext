# A Port of Infima Over to Lume + Vento

This is a theme for Lume built on Infima CSS, the same styles that Docusaurus
uses. This is not an attempt to be Docusaurus, but rather make Infima available
to anyone that works with content-heavy sites with Lume.

Infima was devekioped by Meta in the process of coming up with a framework that
suits the needs of developers, documentarians and even product managers. It's
not as modern as things like Tailwind, but it's extremely easy to use and
extremely flexible when it comes to laying out lots and lots of text.

## Status:

The basic template functionality is done, in that it has a fully-functional 
blog, wiki and content pages to offer.

There is a **[Live Demo](https://cushytext.deno.dev)** of progress deployed from
`main` on Deno Deploy. See the [docs section](https://cushytext.deno.dev/docs/)
for the current status and focus.
