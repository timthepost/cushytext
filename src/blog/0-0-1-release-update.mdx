Want to know what's special about the image below this sentence? It was 
automatically created for the blog post by the 
[OG Image Generator](https://lume.land/plugins/og_images/) plugin. That
leads to my first update: [all of the planned pre-configured plugins](/features/#plugins) 
have been installed and configured to work correctly in conjunction with each
other.

There's more. A lot more. Once the theme is officially released, I'll have a proper
and frequently updated changelog so that users can decide when they want to cherry
pick something new or update.

But for now, you'll just have to get by with me dumping it all in a blog post.

## Search Is Pagefind (Only) For Now

It will continue to be Pagefind into the future, too. I mean it's 
_just_ Pagefind, which is in and of itself a great search engine.

I had planned to use Lume Middleware (Router) to augment search, 
by using the Pagefind API on the back-end and mixing it with
additional sources that can be `fetch()`ed, like a main product site
if Cushy Text is the user portal. 

That's still the plan, but it was too much to take on for the first 
release and still have it out reasonably soon after Lume 3 releases.


## Documentation Mini Engine Is Almost Feature Complete

You can have as many collections of documentation as you want, and 
they'll all get an auto-generated sidebar. You can set up
independent feeds for them as well. 

What it's not doing so well (yet) is handling nested directories.
All the files show up, but there's no inherited category definition,
so it's one long list of links. This will be made more robust in 
`0.0.2`.

## Blog Engine Is Almost Feature Complete

The blog has a nice archive, an optional tag wiki feature and feeds,
along with breadcrumbs and auto navigation / pagination like docs.

You can run several independent blogs, however they'll all share 
the same tag and author archive. Tag and Author archive locations
will be configurable in `0.0.2`.

## Pages & Components Have Been Started

The quest to turn all of the various infima components into easy 
to use MDX elements goes slow, but it does progress. I hope to 
have completely pluggable (around 30 of them) Infima components
done by `0.0.3`, with a few trickling in each release.

## Conductor Plugin Is Stable

The [conductor](/docs/conductor-plugin/) plugin is doing a fine job 
generating TOCs and JSON exports. It's still essential for the theme
to function properly, and will be more essential as the interactive 
features are ready for release.

## Interactive Stuff Has Begun

I'm working now on the content rating system, and the default 
form handler. We'll see what else I can manage to get in.

## "Theme Artifacts" Are Still Needed

I need to create the `mod.ts` and init required for remote installs
as well as the default content generators. The theme will ship with
its own docs, a sample blog post and a content page.

## Lots Of Polish & Shining Needed

Missing Aria labels, tab indexes out of order, roles not set properly,
all of this is lint that has to be shaved off, but that's been happening
pretty quickly as things get finalized.
