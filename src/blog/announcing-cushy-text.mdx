I've built dozens of documentation sites for everything from software to on-prem enterprise
versions of Stack Overflow. My favorite tool to get something documented quickly has always 
been Docusaurus, mostly because of how easy it is to make presentable, accessible and
fully-responsive sites with Infima CSS.

Lately, I've been working primarily with Deno because I'm just tired of Node, and in my
semi-retired years where I just do this stuff for fun and tips, I'd rather work with things
that "spark joy", if you know what I mean?

So what if I took Infima, shoe-horned it into Lume, built a mini docs and blog system on
top of both, and then added interactive features backed by Lume3's new Router middleware,
DenoKV and Deno Deploy? And, no edge functions to mess with, or database strings to manage?

***Yeah! That's what I said!!!!*** Read on, let me show you what I've got going here.

When I set out to make Cushy Text, I thought about every time that I was hired as a 
consultant for a new developer tool that needed a website, documentation and lots of 
blog / tutorial content ***in a hurry***. My role usually entailed serving as the 
initial DevRel, Marketing Manager, Support Specialist and doc site maintainer all-in-one.

Sound familiar?
