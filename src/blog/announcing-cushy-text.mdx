My career in DevRel & Comminity made me responsible for setting up dozens of documentation
sites, blogs and community portals for developer tools. Spending almost a decade working 
for Stack Overflow gave me a special sensitivity for the kind of experience that people who
create or maintain a lot of documentation want out of their tools.

I spent years as an early-stage consultant with newly-funded companies that needed help
spreading the word about their tools, which gave me a lot of experience with different kinds
of text-focused platforms. Gatsby, Docusaurus, Astro and many others are great at what they
do, but I found myself only using and knowing about 35% of their overall features, despite 
lofty sizes.

Other Preact-based alternates like Deno's Fresh framework began to look promising, but they
didn't have all the automatic comforts that the established Node-based frameworks did. That's
when I found Lume and realized just how easy it would be to port Infima CSS over to it, and 
create the minimum features that I wanted in a "go to" self-publishing framework.

I wanted to be able to have an easy blog, the ability to throw a bunch of markdown files
in a directory and end up with a nice auto-generated documentation section independent 
of the blog, easy component-driven landing and content pages, interactive content feedback
features and form handlers, a comprehensive and fully-customizeable search and the familiar
and vetted Infima CSS framework.

I also wanted to have all the great plugins already installed and optimally configured to 
work together, like OG Image auto-generation, Image processing and re-sizing plugins,
all of the SEO-related plugins, MDX with SSX, and pre-configured middleware that Works
the same locally as it does remotely.

Finally, I knew it would need a plugin to help provide some of the functionality and 
provide safety so that people don't get confusing errors if they use features incorrectly.

## It Began As Cushy Docs, Quickly Went To Cushy Text

I wanted something I would have been happy to have in my hands each time I was tasked with 
setting up a presence to support something new. That's not always documentation, I also like
to write serial fiction and biography content, too. I wanted something nice for anyone that 
works with a lot of, well, text.

Rather than think of using a different theme for each kind of thing, I decided to put Infima
to task on creating archetypes to support lots of things in the same place. So far, we have
the following archetypes:

 - Documentation Style Site
 - Blog With Archive, Tag & Author Pages
 - Blog With No Archive (a special release-notes archetype)
 - Inner Content Page (MDX) with navigation
 - Landing Page (MDX) without navigation (grid demo)

The archetypes rely on a few special settings in the per-directory `_data.yml` files that
apply a default layout and special archetype tag `%archetype_name%`, like `%docs%` which 
isn't shown, but can be used to build navigation and filter searches. A base directory is
also set up, which serves as a navigation anchor for auto-generation.

This lets you have, say, 4 independent documentation archetypes and two blogs going at once, 
all with independent nav and tags, but searchable and filterable together as one along with
inner content pages.

Wanna make a new landing page? Easy! Type:

```bash
lume new landing_page "try our new widget"
```

The file will be created with all the necessary frontmatter, and a little demo content with 
components you can use if you need a base to start with.

## If There's A Framework For Building Around Lume3 Components, It's Infima.

(Arguably, this could be said about many, but I picked Infima)

Infima breaks out all styles and supporting JS to individual modules for every componenent
that it comes with. Lume3, now supporting async components by default, also recently went 
with a structure where components can ship a template, css, and js file which all get loaded
just-in-time when the component is used.

This means for brand new sites (if you're not going to import a lot of HTML using infima 
component classes directly), your pages will only have component scripts and styles if 
components get loaded on the page.

This, combined with plugins that garbage collect any unused classes and optimize scripts
plus brotli compression will result in performance as a feature.

## A Little Interactivity Is Good!

The theme will ship with a content-rating system that utilzes local storage and DenoKV as
its backend. It'll ask users how they felt about what they read, allow for voting and even
some free-form feedback. There's no need to worry about edge functions, as Lume's built-in
server middlware makes processing form submissions and KV querying pretty easy. 

There will also be a generic contact form and handler, and maybe even a feature logger.

Don't worry - it all works the same locally as it does in production. 

## Responsive + Accessible = Enjoyable.

Infima makes creating accessible and responsive websites easier than most framworks of its 
type, but mostly through example (e.g. Docusaurus). I wanted to make sure that wasn't lost 
when I brought it over to Infima. 

When it comes to accessibility, being disabled myself, I'm a major stickler. Out of the box, 
it's ideal to offer dark and light themes, reduced motion, proper semantic structure for readers
and all while obeying the user's system preferences.

This theme additionally offers users a dyslexic-friendly font for longer text, called Open Dyslexic,
which can be toggled just like light / dark mode. In fact, the button is a D in a circle, and located
right next to the dark / light switcher.

## You Keep The Ability To "Just Make It Work".

While we'll have nice auto-loading components and efficient use of scripts and CSS, sometimes,
you just need to cobble something presentable together quickly and just make it work.

Infima ships with plenty of helper classes to tweak margins and padding and placement of things,
but you can also use a variety of third-party Markdown plugins, just like you could use in any 
other Lume site. There's no guarded, rigid configuration to contend with. 

You could totally drop everything and load jQuery; the theme will still work just fine. While
it ships with a lot of cool features, it's still just a theme, and meant to be completely 
changed and customized so it works as well for you as it does for me. 

You won't feel like you're going "against" a platform, unless you do something to make Lume 
mad at you, but that goes with any theme.
