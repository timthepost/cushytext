When I set out to make my ideal setup for a text-heavy site, I stopped and thought about
the dozens and dozens of features that platforms like Docusuarus bring to the table and 
remembered the approximately 30% of them that I've ever used. 

The `docs/` implementation ended up being, rather accidentally, more robust than I planned
because it lets a few lines of YAML in a file turn any directory into an auto-generated
book complete with navigation.

But this is a Lume theme aimed for text-heavy projects, not really a _documentation
platform_ like Gitbook, Docusaurus or others. Here's a list of objectives that I want
to achieve with it, as well as some non-goals, like making documentation the focus of 
the theme.
