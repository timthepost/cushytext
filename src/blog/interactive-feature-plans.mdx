One of my favorite things about Lume is how easy it makes adding a touch of interactivity
to static sites through the new router middleware. From a documentarian perspective, this
gives many the ability to communicate with their audiences more directly, outside of what 
you can infer from analytics and data.

I wanted to share more about ideas I had for additional islands of interactivity that
text-heavy sites could use, with some thoughts on which ones I'm planning to try to bring
to Cushy Text by default.

First, we should probably talk about the decision to have Deno Deploy as a dependency, 
because it wasn't easy. But, the benefits of the tight coupling between bare-metal Deno,
plus DenoKV, made it the right choice because it unlocks so many other possibilities.
