# Blog Index Page / Archive Page

This will present the latest posts (and maybe some featured ones?) by
default, or serve as an archive. It should have posts, a selection of 
the most used tags, and the ability to drill down / search.

This layout is `layouts/post-archive.vto` and `post-archive-template.vto`.

**Take a look at [an example blog post](/blog/mdx-post/).**

## Auto Generated 

I plan to use the infima image cards to make a nice grid display of posts 
using OG images. This is going to get a lot of help from the JSON that the
`_plugins/cushy-docs-conductor` generates, at least for tags. The rest of
the posts are a simple `site.search()`, I think.

## Can we do better than a list of stuff?

A blog landing should be inviting and give a good breadth of things someone
can find there. I would envision someone would want fast access to release 
notes, easily scoped tutorials, etc. This is mostly lifting that the tag 
engine can do.

A sidebar may make sense for polls or surveys? Have to experiment and see.
