# A "Cushy" ☁️ Docu-Site Base Template For Lume

Infima is a great framework for content-heavy sites. I thought
it would be great to use in Lume. 

See `/pages` for pages, `/docs` for documentation and `/posts` for the
blog styles. I don't have indexes worked out yet. Or tags.

Search will require using lume's router middleware to just use the pagefind
API (since pagefind breaks this template with its styles)

All of the components (hero, buttons, breadcrumbs, pills, badges, admonitions,
etc) will be Lume3 components with styles compartmentalized.

See `src/style.css` for colors. Currently working on nav and generation stuff.

This is nowhere near ready for use, is probably broken, and not really documented
yet.

## Motivation (Why Infima?)

Infima CSS is the framework that emerged from the
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) project, developed out-in-the-open by Meta
as they explored what technical writers _really_ need and want out of the
creation experience. Infima is that result and has developed a solid following,
despite a drift toward frameworks like Tailwind.

Some of us are interested in retaining the character it developed as it evolved
specifically for content-heavy sites, despite a lack of frills and longer
markup.

When Meta open-sourced Infima, they specifically said:

> but in the usual Facebook fashion, we decided to separate out the CSS layer
> into a separate project such that websites interested in adopting a
> documentation-site styling could use it too.

This is precisely that kind of case.
