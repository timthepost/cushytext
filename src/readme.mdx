# A "Cushy" ☁️ Docu-Site Base Template For Lume

<strong>
[Get this sloppy MDX code on Github](https://github.com/timthepost/lume-infima)
</strong>

This theme was put together in order to bring a documentation site theme with a
familiar content-optimized CSS framework (Infima, used by Docusaurus) along with
popular plugins and dynamic features that any technical documentation author
would want.

I decided that it's worth doing this _really well_ one time, in a way that
leaves a lasting artifact for others, than to half-ass it a dozen times across
the projects that all develop different persistent bugs and ick to maintain.

<div class="alert alert--danger margin-bottom--lg" role="alert">
  This is <strong>ALPHA-QUALITY</strong> code. Expect many breaking changes.
</div>

## The Big Wishlist / Initial Features:

- Infima CSS (ideally loadable per-component)
- Basic search pre-configured
- Redirects, Site Map, Gtag integration
- Content Rating Feature Using Lume Routing Functionality along with backend ✨
- Font Accessibility Selector (optional: Open Dyslexic) + Google Font Manager
- MDX
- Example layouts:
  - Blog Post
  - Blog Archive Page
  - Index W / Hero & Features
  - Doc With Sidebar
  - 9x9 Grid Layout
- Components for UX candy (pills, buttons, admonitions, etc}

## Archetypes for CLI

- Front / Landing page with hero and features
- Landing / Inner content page with nav bar, bread crumbs and pagination
- Blog Post layout
- Adjustable grid layout example
- Documentation page with sidebars, codeblocks

### Motivation (Why Infima?)

Infima CSS is the framework that emerged from the
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) project, developed out-in-the-open by Meta
as they explored what technical writers _really_ need and want out of the
creation experience. Infima is that result and has developed a solid following,
despite a drift toward frameworks like Tailwind.

Some of us are interested in retaining the character it developed as it evolved
specifically for content-heavy sites, despite a lack of frills and longer
markup.

When Meta open-sourced Infima, they specifically said:

> but in the usual Facebook fashion, we decided to separate out the CSS layer
> into a separate project such that websites interested in adopting a
> documentation-site styling could use it too.

This is precisely that kind of case.

### Swim at Your Own Risk!

Expect daily breaking changes when I'm active, and frequent bouts of me not
being active. This project is being built along side some professional writing
projects I'm working on to supplement my needs as a disabled person, so I only
have so many spoons, but I really need _this_ framework in order to achieve the
results I want in those projects; out in the open seemed like a great place to
build.

I'm `timthepost@protonmail.com` if you want to collaborate, you can also find me
in the [Lume Discord](https://discord.gg/DTGe9UFA) server.
