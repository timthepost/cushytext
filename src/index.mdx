# Goals:

 - Be component driven (all [infima features](/features/) should be Lume 3 
   components), this includes the hero banner above this content. Infima 
   ships with _mostyly_ separate JS for each component, so brand new sites
   can load component code only when components are used. Yay! ***However***, 
   some users may want to import a lot of content with hard-coded JSX using 
   the styles directly; they can use the original theme CSS file that has 
   all of the components combined.

   We'll probably have `theme-full.css` (with everything in it) and 
   `theme-componentless.css` (with all the component css moved to individual
   plugin styles). We'll also have a combined JS in addition to moving all
   of the component-specific JS to the individual folders.

 - Be i18n friendly, but don't go overboard. See also "Don't try to be 
   Docusaurus" below.

 - Bring a touch of interactivity (content rating, contact form) using Lume's
   router middleware + DenoKV for a nearly zero-config experience.

 - Nice plugin setup from the start (including fonts, accessible font switcher,
   Dynamic OG Image, compression, minification, etc)

 - Implement site tags with an eye toward making them smart (some tags could also
   flip feature flags), export tags to JSON so other things can use them.

 - No cookies / cookie banners. 

 - Accessibility Matters.

 - Don't be fragile: set defaults for things. Make taking the correct path easier 
   than not wherever possible.

 - DevEx should match production (middlewares, redirects, etc)

## Non-Goals:

 - Do not try to be Docusaurus: offer basic nav with some additional options in
   the `_data.yml` files, generate a blog index and archive page, and that's it.
   Not doing extensive sidebars, collections, versioning or anything else like 
   that. Maintainers can add functionality via plugins or additional generators.
   This is a fully-loaded theme, not really a platform in itself. It could be the
   start of a platform, though.

## Current Status As Of February 2025:

  - Infima has been imported (`src/_includes/css/theme.css` with color and main variable
  definitions found in `src/style.css`). The `src/style.css` is what's loaded by the theme,
  which loads the `theme.css` file. `_includes/js/infima` has all of the component JS 
  broken out into individual files, but there's some shared functions to resolve. The only 
  generated nav right now is in `docs/`. 

  - Basic structure (pages in `/pages`, documentation-style files in `/docs`, posts in `/blog`
  ) has been set up. Current focus is getting the nav auto generated with some yaml tweaks for
  it where appropriate.

  - Now running Lume 3 Dev 

  - Focusing on making nav elegant, additional plugins and setup they require, blog functionality
    as well as some kind of tag engine. I'm working on code that doesn't depend on a lot of brand 
    new Lume code while the dust settles in Lume 3. 

## What's really really exciting, is ....

Fairly soon, this will be one of the easiest docs site solutions to set up, complete with all
the interactive features that usually aren't found in static generated sites. This will be
almost zero config, including database, because it's just going to use DenoKV.

There are no edge functions to debug or maintain. I repeat, no edge functions. This will ship 
with working middleware that can handle form submissions and basic API requests. 

This should be really helpful for anyone who has a project they need to document and keep 
a changelog for, as well as great for making marketing landing pages with easy MDX. Anyone 
that can use Markdown can create great websites using this. 

And there's almost no Node.

That's just cool. Really cool.
