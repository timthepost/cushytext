<h2>We Also Pay Close Attention To The Following:</h2>
<strong>Small things can make a big difference:</strong>
</div>

 - Internationalization and Accessibility are important.

 - Don't introduce any need for a cookie banner.

 - Search & Tags should be a tight, smooth coupling. 

 - Pre-configure popular plugins with optimal settings for this theme (OG Image, 
   Sitemap, Feeds, Redirects, Link Check, Metas, Minifiers, Etc..)

 - ***Don't Be Fragile!*** Set defaults. Assume people will use it incorrectly. Make
   doing the correct thing easier than not, whenever possible. 

 - Prefer readability over optimization. See also: _don't be fragile_.

<h2>Things We Try To Avoid (AKA Non-Goals):</h2>
<strong>Resist The Gravity Of Feature Creep!</strong>
</div>

  - **Don't Try To Be A Total Documentation Platform** 
 
    The theme offers three MDX (via SSX) archetypes by default:
      
      - ***Blog Posts*** - For release notes, or whatever you want to write. The
        blog is pretty full-featured.

      - ***Inner Content Pages*** - Envisioned as an easy way for non-developers
        to create landing and content pages with MDX and the provided components.

      - ***Documentation Pages*** - Envisioned as a way to publish documentation
        for software (usually auto-generated by documentation tools), or for recipes,
        or whatever you need to document.
    
    
    The goal of these archetypes is to give users of this theme _a good start_ toward
    any or all of those endeavors. We can offer theme functionality like auto generated
    navigation, search, content rating, etc - but we have to stop somewhere. We're a theme
    for writers, not a documentation platform.

  - Documentation versioning, comprehensive sidebar logic, or really any substantive
    additions to the documentation instances. Think in terms of plugins for things like 
    that. I have no interest in maintaining a whole platform; individual plugins lets
    that work be spread more evenly. Remember, this is a theme, not a whole platform.

<h3>Current Status (As Of February 2025):</h3>
<strong>30% Done; Should Be Done Shortly After Lume 3 Ships.</strong>
</div>

  - Infima has been imported (`src/_includes/css/theme.css` with color and main variable
  definitions found in `src/style.css`). The `src/style.css` is what's loaded by the theme,
  which loads the `theme.css` file. `_includes/js/infima` has all of the component JS 
  broken out into individual files, but there's some shared functions to resolve. The only 
  generated nav right now is in `docs/`. 

  - Basic structure (pages in `/pages`, documentation-style files in `/docs`, posts in `/blog`
  ) has been set up. Current focus is getting the nav auto generated with some yaml tweaks for
  it where appropriate.

  - Now running Lume 3 Dev 

  - Focusing on making nav elegant, additional plugins and setup they require, blog functionality
    as well as some kind of tag engine. I'm working on code that doesn't depend on a lot of brand 
    new Lume code while the dust settles in Lume 3.

### Installing:

This is not yet a usable theme. It's available to those who want to help build the remaining parts 
needed for the theme to be usable. 

If that sounds like you, or if you just want to poke around, clone this repository and then type:

```bash
$ deno task dev
```

This starts the lume server that reloads on changes, and also sets the `LUME_DRAFTS` environmental
variable high so you can see your drafts as you write them. Don't want drafts? Type:

```bash
$ deno task serve
```

This will start the Lume server (without drafts being processed).
