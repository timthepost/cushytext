## Additional Project Goals And Aspirations:

No-one likes cookie banners, and an explicit goal of this theme is to
offer islands of interactivity without requiring the use of cookies. Local
storage is utilized with graceful checks to store interaction data (votes, 
ratings, and other things), but always treated as ephemeral. Sure, people 
might vote twice for the same post. Is stopping that worth forcing people
to sign in? I don't believe it is.

The authoring experience is equally as important as the user's reading experience,
because one leads to the other. Local development should match what's in
production without mocking or additional configuration. Try to make it easier to do
the correct thing than not, wherever possible. 
 
Tags and search should be gracefully integrated. Remember that some government 
and NGO websites, like those that list data about medications, can be tens of thousands 
of nodes long. Research projects can be thousands of nodes with hundreds of tags. But,
the average user will have a hundred pages and 20 tags or fewer. Think big, but make 
any size a joy to navigate.

<strong><code>tl;dr:</code> 30% Done; Should Be Done Shortly After Lume 3 Ships.</strong>

### Progress So Far:

  - Infima has been imported (`src/_includes/css/theme.css` with color and main variable
  definitions found in `src/style.css`). The `src/style.css` is what's loaded by the theme,
  which loads the `theme.css` file. `_includes/js/infima` has all of the component JS 
  broken out into individual files, but there's some shared functions to resolve. The only 
  generated nav right now is in `docs/`. 

  - Basic structure (pages in `/pages`, documentation-style files in `/docs`, posts in `/blog`
  ) has been set up. Current focus is getting the nav auto generated with some yaml tweaks for
  it where appropriate.

  - Now running Lume 3 Dev

  - Internationalization in-progress

  - Components in-progress (mostly async vento at this point, until Lume3 bakes more)

  - Focusing on making nav elegant, additional plugins and setup they require, blog functionality
    as well as some kind of tag engine. I'm working on code that doesn't depend on a lot of brand 
    new Lume code while the dust settles in Lume 3.

  - Building out the project site (site for this template) using this template. 

### Installing:

This is not yet a usable theme. It's available to those who want to help build the remaining parts 
needed for the theme to be usable. 

If that sounds like you, or if you just want to poke around, clone this repository and then type:

```bash
$ deno task dev
```

This starts the lume server that reloads on changes, and also sets the `LUME_DRAFTS` environmental
variable high so you can see your drafts as you write them. Don't want drafts? Type:

```bash
$ deno task serve
```

This will start the Lume server (without drafts being processed).

#### Contributing:
