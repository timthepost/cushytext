## Being A Joy To Use Produces Better Content Results

No one likes a content system that blows up in your face or 
one that doesn't consider creation and curation as important
as consumption. We like systems that let us get things done
without imposing a lot of structure or restriction, but that
also effectively brings order to chaos.

You like to be able to tweak styles in markup when you have 
to, but appreciate well-planned CSS so that you don't have
too many kludges waiting to blow. You want guardrails, but 
not imposition or being forced to use someone else's idea of
a site layout. You don't want a cookie banner or the headache
of debugging edge functions, but you want some interactive 
features.

You're not a designer, but somehow, you can make Infima look
like anything. You don't want to use Yarn again. Ever.

If that sounds like you and you use Deno, you might want to 
give Cushy Text + Lume a try!
