# Goals:

 - Be component driven (all [infima features](/features/) should be Lume 3 
   components), this includes the hero banner above this content. However,
   one shouldn't _be required_ to use the component form of something in 
   all applications, so the component CSS is kept global, with override
   CSS files affecting only the component styles on a per-component basis.

   Likewise, JS component events still run globally; components can introduce
   additional JS if needed. We'll have to figure that out.

 - Be i18n friendly, but don't go overboard. See also "Don't try to be 
   Docusaurus" below.

 - Bring a touch of interactivity (content rating, contact form) using Lume's
   router middleware + DenoKV for a nearly zero-config experience.

 - Nice plugin setup from the start (including fonts, accessible font switcher,
   Dynamic OG Image, compression, minification, etc)

 - Implement site tags with an eye toward making them smart (some tags could also
   flip feature flags), export tags to JSON so other things can use them.

 - No cookies / cookie banners. 

 - Accessibility Matters.

 - Don't be fragile: set defaults for things. Make taking the correct path easier 
   than not wherever possible.

 - DevEx should match production (middlewares, redirects, etc)

## Non-Goals:

 - Do not try to be Docusaurus: offer basic nav with some additional options in
   the `_data.yml` files, generate a blog index and archive page, and that's it.
   Not doing extensive sidebars, collections, versioning or anything else like 
   that. Maintainers can add functionality via plugins or additional generators.
   This is a fully-loaded theme, not really a platform in itself. It could be the
   start of a platform, though.

## Current Status As Of February 2025:

  - Infima has been imported (`src/_includes/css/theme.css` with color and main variable
  definitions found in `src/style.css`). The `src/style.css` is what's loaded by the theme,
  which loads the `theme.css` file. Note that, soon, component-specific styles (Like breadcrumbs, 
  tabs, buttons, pills, etc) will be compartmentalized in `_plugins/(component)/style.css`. Right 
  now, `main.js` sets up all of the helper JS for each one, we'll move this to a per-component model 
  too. There is no need to set up event listeners until the content actually exists.

  - Basic structure (pages in `/pages`, documentation-style files in `/docs`, posts in `/blog`
  ) has been set up. Current focus is getting the nav auto generated with some yaml tweaks for
  it where appropriate.

  - Now running Lume 3 Dev 

Not much else has been finished yet.
