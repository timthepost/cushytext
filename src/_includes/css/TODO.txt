Currently, theme-dark.css and theme-light.css are generated from a build in 
the infima repository. Ideally, we just use the PostCSS plugin here and build
them from source, so that we can load them as components as-needed instead
of the entire honking framework on every request. 

Someone better with PostCSS (even though my last name is Post (btw, feel free
to ask me about how that's going)) than me needs to take a look at just how that's
going to happen. 

I've included the gulpfile and everything else from:

https://github.com/facebookincubator/infima

See the stuff in the infima-postcss-src directory.
