# What Are Archetypes?

In Lume, _archetypes_ are scripts that Lume runs which can create base 
content for blog posts, content pages, photo galleries, or whatever other
content you have. 

## Cushy Text Extends Archetypes To Directories

In addition to scripts, this theme also uses hints from directory-level
`_data.yml` files that help trigger the generation of three distinct 
types of content:

 - `blog` : A blog with a working tag system, feeds, archive, tag and 
    author pages. Supports multiple instances with independent tags.

 - `docs` : Like a blog, but sidebar is auto generated, no archive pages, 
   tag pages, or author pages. Tags can be applied to help guide search, 
   but are only used for taxonomy. Supports multiple instances with 
   independent tags.

 - `pages` : Full-page, sidebar-less MDX pages that aren't auto-linked, but
    can be tagged and are searchable. Meant for creating long-form content, 
    galleries, presentations, landing pages, company branding or whatever.
    Essentially the default when no archetype is specified in data.


To give you an idea of how this works, right now, you're actually in `/docs`,
which is a `docs` archetype (a documentation area, not robust like a blog). 
Let's take a look at the `_data.yml` file inside this directory, which affects
this directory, and all directories within it:

```yml
layout: layouts/docs.vto
waypoint: "%docs%"

docs:
  basedir: /docs/
  title: Documentation Home
  sidebar: auto

```

This means every file in the `/docs` directory:

 - Uses the `layouts/docs.vto` template when rendering (unless another 
   is specified in the individual frontmatter layout key)
 - Has a waypoint applied to it that internal searching to build navigation,
   archives, feeds and more can use in order to include or exclude it.
 - Has some additional configuration options to support the docs archetype, 
   like if the sidebar should be auto-generated
 - Knows what the root install of its instance is, so it can re-think relative
   links and paths as necessary. No extra JS cwd() in templates needed.

That special `waypoint` key is what I call a, well, _waypoint_. It lets me 
run multiple installations of `docs` while including or excluding some 
or all from the site feed, navigation, archive pages, etc.

Now, let's take a look at the `blog` directory `_data.yml` file:

```yml
layout: layouts/post.vto
waypoint: "%blog%"
tags: []

blog:
  basedir: /blog/
  title: Cushy Text Blog
  recent: 5
```

This works similarly to docs, but gives me a separate way to scope the 
content with behind the scenes: `%blog%`. It also makes sure `tags` is 
at least _set_, even if it's just an empty array, to avoid onerous 
checks in templates.

You can run multiple independent, or even coupled blogs and documentation
installations on the same site like this. I highly recommend reading up 
on Lume's [powerful Search Plugin](https://lume.land/plugins/search/) to
see what inspiration hits!

## What About "pages"?

The `pages` archetype is under construction and will depend on finishing 
all of the components so that they can be made available as MDX elements.

## Creation Scripts Included

You'll find `blog.ts`, `doc.ts` and `page.ts` included in `src/_archetypes`;
I plan to also make a CLI tool to trigger some of these scripts which also
accepts and validates the proposed paths. That's out of scope for what the 
Lume CLI tool does, so I plan to offer / include one.

Like, `cushy create blog "some title here" docs/` should error, because
docs has no `blog` key, but would work if you ran it on `blog/`.
