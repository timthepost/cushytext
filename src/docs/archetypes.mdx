# Data Files & Special Hidden Tags:

<span class="text--danger">
***Warning: This will be changing very soon.*** From the [index](/docs/):
</span>

> Re-designing archetype tags like `%blog%` to be something called _waypoints_
> instead, which won't pollute `tags` but still provide the same functionality 
> when it comes to scoping individual archetype installations expressively. 

So expect the following:

 - No more meddling with `tags`
 - `waypoints` will work just like `tags`, except we only ever touch them 
    in `_data.yml` (conductor can do sanity checks).
 - can use `waypoints` in _addition_ to tags now in searches, which is way better.
 - No more need to special-case `tag[0]` in view code.
 - No need for tag helpers

This change came about as a result of talking with Ã“scar Otero and 
explaining that the choice of using tags for beacons was because of the 
merge behavior mentioned specifically for tags. He told me that it's 
also guaranteed to be the same for other data, tags aren't unique in
that regard, so we can hop into our own space for this.

The rest of the docs here still _mostly_ apply, with that change in mind, 
but the `_data` files will likely be simpler. This doesn't affect how the 
generators work. 

## What Are Archetypes?

In Lume, _archetypes_ are scripts that Lume runs which can create base 
content for blog posts, content pages, photo galleries, or whatever other
content you have. 

## Cushy Text Extends Archetypes To Directories

In addition to scripts, this theme also uses hints from directory-level
`_data.yml` files that help trigger the generation of three distinct 
types of content:

 - `blogs` : A blog with a working tag system, feeds, archive, tag and 
    author pages. Supports multiple instances with independent tags.

 - `docs` : Like a blog, but sidebar is auto generated, no archive pages, 
   tag pages, or author pages. Tags can be applied to help guide search, 
   but are only used for taxonomy. Supports multiple instances with 
   independent tags.

 - `pages` : Full-page, sidebar-less MDX pages that aren't auto-linked, but
    can be tagged and are searchable. Meant for creating long-form content, 
    galleries, presentations, landing pages, company branding or whatever.
    Essentially the default when no archetype is specified in data.


To give you an idea of how this works, right now, you're actually in `/docs`,
which is a `docs` archetype (a documentation area, not robust like a blog). 
Let's take a look at the `_data.yml` file inside this directory, which affects
this directory, and all directories within it:

```yml
# This makes it a documentation page with a sidebar 
layout: layouts/docs.vto
# This lets searches include or exclude content from this folder
tags:
  - "%docs%" 
# This controls the behavior of this docs folder
docs:
  basedir: /docs/
  archetypeTag: "%docs%"
  title: Documentation Home
  sidebar: auto
```

This means every file in the `/docs` directory:

 - Uses the `layouts/docs.vto` template when rendering (unless another 
   is specified in the individual frontmatter layout key)
 - Has the hidden "archetype" tag `%docs%` applied to it (more on this later) 
   no matter what is specified in the individual frontmatter tags thanks to 
   how merging works in Lume. We take advantage of this.
 - Has some additional configuration options to support the docs archetype, 
   like if the sidebar should be auto-generated

That special `%docs%` tag is what I call an archetype tag. It allows each instance
to be independently searched and filtered in both site searches and nav building, 
and is only used behind the scenes, visitors won't see it. 

Now, let's take a look at the `blog` directory `_data.yml` file:

```yml
layout: layouts/post.vto
tags:
  - "%blog%"

blog:
  basedir: /blog/
  archetypeTag: "%blog%"
  title: Cushy Text Blog
  recent: 5
```

This works similarly to docs, but gives me a separate tag to scope the 
content with behind the scenes: `%blog%`. These special tags aren't shown
anywhere, just used to build the site and will be available as search
options once that's fully-baked. These tags become anchors to search or
exclude specific parts of the site.

## What About "pages"?

The `pages` archetype is under construction and will depend on finishing 
all of the components so that they can be made available as MDX elements.

## Creation Scripts Included

You'll find `blog.ts`, `doc.ts` and `page.ts` included in `src/_archetypes`;
I plan to also make a CLI tool to trigger some of these scripts which also
accepts and validates the proposed paths. That's out of scope for what the 
Lume CLI tool does, so I plan to offer / include one.

Like, `cushy create blog "some title here" docs/` should error, because
docs has no `blog` key, but would work if you ran it on `blog/`.
