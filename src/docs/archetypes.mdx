# Extensions To The Archetype Concept

***Warning: This is a rapidly-evolving feature and changing quickly. I
may switch to a `_data.ts` format for docs (and maybe blogs).***

In Lume, _archetypes_ are scripts that Lume runs which can create base 
content for blog posts, content pages, photo galleries, or whatever other
content you have. 

In addition to scripts, this theme also uses hints from directory-level
`_data.yml` files that help provide three distinct types of content:

 - `blogs` : A blog with a working tag system, feeds, archive, tag and 
    author pages. Supports multiple instances with independent tags.

 - `docs` : Like a blog, but sidebar is auto generated, no archive pages, 
   tag pages, or author pages. Tags can be applied to help guide search, 
   but are only used for taxonomy. Supports multiple instances with 
   independent tags.

 - `pages` : Full-page, sidebar-less MDX pages that aren't auto-linked, but
    can be tagged and are searchable. Meant for creating long-form content, 
    galleries, presentations, landing pages, company branding or whatever.
    Essentially the default when no archetype is specified in data.


Let's take a look at the `_data.yml` file in `/docs` directory on this site:

```yml
# This makes it a documentation page with a sidebar 
layout: layouts/docs.vto
# This lets searches include or exclude content from this folder
tags:
  - "%docs%" 

# This controls the behavior of this docs folder
docs:
  basedir: /docs/
  archetypeTag: "%docs%"
  title: Documentation Home
  sidebar: auto
```

This means every file in the `/docs` directory will:

 - Use the `layouts/docs.vto` template when rendering
 - Have the hidden "archetype" tag  `%docs%` (more on that later)
 - Has some additional configuration options to support the docs archetype

That special `%docs%` tag is what I call an archetype tag. It allows each instance
to be independently searched and filtered in both site searches and nav building, 
and is only used behind the scenes, visitors won't see it.

Now, let's take a look at the `blog` directory `_data.yml` file:

```yml
layout: layouts/post.vto
tags:
  - "%blog%"

blog:
  basedir: /blog/
  archetypeTag: "%blog%"
  title: Cushy Text Blog
  recent: 5
```

## Creating Content With Archetypes

Use `lume new <archetype> <path>/<slug>` and a file with all needed frontmatter 
appropriate for the archetype will be generated for you. I'm working on a CLI 
tool that does more sanity and error checking.

This will create a new file with all the frontmatter and starter content you 
need. For instance, if you decide you want image galleries, your `gallery` 
archetype would need a script that produced a `.vto` file with a 12x12 grid
or a carousel.

## Why Archetypes? Why Add Complexity?

I wanted a setup where I can just drop different kinds of content in folders
and have it come out beautifully, and where creating new content is just a few
keystrokes before I'm writing and editing.
