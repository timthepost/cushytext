# Local Admin Area

This is a page left on draft so it never gets rendered and served by
the server. It only renders when you're using `lume -s` locally, with
`LUME_DRAFTS` set in the environment.

Use the `feedbackAdmin` component to view and manage feedback, like
this:

```js
<comp.feedbackAdmin />
```

Which produces this:

<comp.feedbackAdmin />

Feel free to remove this file if you like. The reason it's at the top
of the navigation list is because its order is `-1`.
