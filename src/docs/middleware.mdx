# {title}

Normally, words like "middleware" aren't very exciting, but the Router that 
is shipping in Lume 3 is what enables static sites to have interactive functions
without having to fuss with edge functions.

On Deno Deploy, Lume runs by Deno running `src/_serve.ts`, which loads `_server_routes.ts`.
which makes the same server handing out all of your pages also accept form submissions 
and relay responses to them. And, it works locally or remotely the exact same way!

## How Is Middleware Set Up?

If you run the local server on port 3000 and go to `/api`, you'll see a timestamp. It's
being dynamically generated by a handler in `_server_routes.ts`, which is where the theme
middleware ships. 

Here:<strong> <a href="/api" target="_blank">try it live here on the current site</a>
</strong>, then have a look at the code that produces it:

```js
import Router from "lume/middlewares/router.ts";

const router = new Router();

router.get("/api", ({ _request }) => {
  const ts = Date.now();
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ping: ts }), { status: 200 });
});

export default router;
```

This is imported by the production `_serve.ts` when it serves your 
site on Deno Deploy, and is also loaded by Lume's local server when 
you start it. 

You can set up synchronous or asynchronous handlers for `GET`, `POST`, 
`DELETE` (and whatever else), where you can do I/O with DenoKV or 
other databases, await the return of `fetch()` to pull in content, or 
whatever you'd normally use edge functions for.

This isn't for serving dynamic pages, just for handling things that
are needed to bring interactivity to sites.

## Roadmap 

Almost all of the [planned interactive features](/blog/interactive-feature-plans/) 
will use this.
