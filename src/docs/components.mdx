In the simplest form, a [component in Lume][1] is just a bit of 
HTML with some variables that is returned by an asynchronous 
function; great for creating the little utilities that make
creating pages easier and more maintainable.

An example of a component used in the site right now is the one
that fetches the latest blog post on this site's index page, 
which comes from `src/_components/latestBlog.vto`:

```js
{{ for post of search.pages(
    "waypoint=%blog% menu.visible=true", 
    "date=desc", (max_posts || 1)) }}
    <!--  show the content of max_posts posts -->
{{ /for }}
```

This is called in the index template with the following code:

```js
  {{ await comp.latestBlog({ max_posts: 1 }) }}
```

Neat, right?

But it relies on a bunch of CSS and other stuff already being loaded. That's not always
ideal on very large sites. What if all the CSS and JS needed to support it could be loaded
on-demand as I used it?

That would be really cool, and that's what's happening in Lume.

## New Component Layout In Lume 3

Instead of just `_components/` with a bunch of files, we're moving to this structure:

```
  _components/
      - _latestBlog
          - comp.vto
          - comp.css
          - comp.js
```

So, when you used `comp.latestBlog()`, it would automatically load what it
needs, no need to load all the styles for [all of the infima components and 
helpers][2]. We'll still have a way for those who have existing code and 
need all the styles to be global, but for new sites starting out, the goal 
is very little unused template code.

Optimization and removing unused classes is of course going to happen in 
plugins, but there's still a lot of potential per-page savings. And, these
components easily transcend into MDX, which will be well-documented once
Lume 3 is stable.

Right now, development is happening against `v3-dev`, which is actually 
rather stable, but there's a ton of new stuff for those not already caught 
up.

## The Goal: Infima Components Pluggable In This Scheme

Eventually, all of the Infima components as well as things like tag 
and navigation helpers will be available as components. When writing
something that runs more than once, or in more than one place, think
strongly about making it a component. 

The `pages` archetype is the last one to be finished, and it will be the 
result of being able to produce real results with very little markup or
deep programming or design knowledge using these components.
