# Cushy Docs Ships With Its Own Plugins

I needed a lightweight TOC plugin to work independently of the 
Markdown plugin being used, so I ended up writing one myself 
which does a pretty good job if you prefer a simple, flat 
TOC like I do.

If you don't, and prefer a more indented one, I'll happily take
a PR.

I also ended up writing a SEO plugin that catches a huge number of 
common mistakes before they mess up your site's SEO standing. I don't
make promises on results, only that you'll get in the way of them 
less through common mistakes.

## TOC Options & configuration

***The theme will not function properly with this plugin removed.***

Unless, of course, you install another Markdown plugin to handle it.

There are the configurable options to control generation:

| Function | Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Configured Value |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| TOC | `toc_selector` | string | ID of the container where the generated TOC will land. | `#toc` | `#toc` |
| TOC | `toc_container` | string | Class name of the container to scan for headings. | `.toc-enabled` | `.toc-enabled` |
| TOC | `toc_heading_selectors` | string | Comma-separated list of headings to process. | `h2, h3, h4, h5, h6` | `h2, h3, h4, h5, h6` |
| TOC | `toc_list_class` | string | Class name to apply to the generated TOC list. | empty | `table-of-contents padding-top--none` |
| TOC | `toc_link_class` | string | Class name to apply to generated TOC links. | empty | `table-of-contents__link` |

And, here's how the plugin is loaded in the theme (from `plugins.ts`):

```js
  .use(conductor({
    // Container where the TOC is deposited once generated
    toc_selector: "#toc",
    // Content within this container is scanned for headings
    toc_container: ".toc-enabled",
    // Headings to scan for and extract / anchor 
    toc_heading_selectors: "h2, h3, h4, h5, h6",
    // class to apply to generated TOC links
    toc_link_class: "table-of-contents__link",
    // class to apply to generated TOC list
    toc_list_class: "table-of-contents padding-top--none",
  }))
```

## SEO Static Analysis Plugin (AKA Simple SEO)

<comp.alert type="danger" message="***Here Be Dragons!***<br />Currently being re-written to use the DOM API and have a better on save update strategy." />

This plugin looks at your posts and does some static analysis work 
then generates a report. Things that it looks at are:

 - Length of title, meta tags, content, description, etc.

 - Percentage of common words used in key parts of the content and meta
   tags

 - Document outline conformance (h1 - h6 tags in order)

 - HTML element attributes, like alt text and titles 

 - Common words in slugs, URLs and Headings

 - More as the project evolves

Some of these checks also coincide with accessibility checks, and that's
no coincidence at all, because accessible sites are easily parsed by 
machines. It's also important to show crawlers that you care about the 
experience that visitors have on your site, including visitors that 
have problems seeing, or using a mouse.
