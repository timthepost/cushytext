# {title}

The _conductor_ plugin is a plugin that does little things to make 
the theme work nicely, but things that are also a little too small
to warrant their own plugin.

***The theme will not work properly if this plugin is removed.***

For instance, it generates the table of contents for both the Blog
and Documentation archetypes through an event that runs at pre-render.
It also handles handing off and validating data between functional 
parts of the site.

## Options

Once things settle I'll create a nice table here, but for now it's
easiest to just show you the code and defaults:

```js
interface Options {
  toc_selector?: string;
  toc_container?: string;
  toc_heading_selectors?: string;
  toc_list_class?: string;
  toc_link_class?: string;
}

export const defaults: Options = {
  toc_selector: "#toc",
  toc_container: ".toc-enabled",
  toc_heading_selectors: "h2, h3, h4, h5, h6",
  toc_link_class: "",
  toc_list_class: "",
};
```

And, here's how it's loaded in the theme:

```js
  .use(conductor({
    // Container where the TOC is deposited once generated
    toc_selector: "#toc",
    // Content within this container is scanned for headings
    toc_container: ".toc-enabled",
    // Headings to scan for and extract / anchor 
    toc_heading_selectors: "h2, h3, h4, h5, h6",
    // class to apply to generated TOC links
    toc_link_class: "table-of-contents__link",
    // class to apply to generated TOC list
    toc_list_class: "table-of-contents padding-top--none",
  }))
```
## Data Preprocessing

Right now, the plugin examines the `author` key, transforms spaces to dashes, 
and then saves it as `safe_author` so it's easy to use without constantly 
calling `.replace()` in templates.

## Roadmap

Anything that needs to be done through an event or on startup to make the theme
function properly can go in the conductor, that's what it's here for.
