# {title}

The _conductor_ plugin is a plugin that does little things to make 
the theme work nicely, but things that are also a little too small
to warrant their own plugin.

For instance, it generates the table of contents for both the Blog
and Documentation archetypes through an event that runs at pre-render.

## Options

Once things settle I'll create a nice table here, but for now it's
easiest to just show you the code and defaults:

```js
interface Options {
  toc_selector?: string;
  toc_container?: string;
  toc_heading_selectors?: string;
}

export const defaults: Options = {
  toc_selector: "#toc",
  toc_container: ".toc-enabled",
  toc_heading_selectors: "h2, h3, h4, h5, h6",
};
```

## Roadmap

This will likely also create JSON data that other features need, or 
do things like update a back-end report for the content rating plugins, 
or things like that. Not really a kitchen sink plugin, but just something
that keeps things running smoothly.
