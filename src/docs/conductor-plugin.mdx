# {title}

The _conductor_ plugin is a plugin that does little things to make 
the theme work nicely, but things that are also a little too small
to warrant their own plugin.

***The theme will not work properly if this plugin is removed.***

For instance, it generates the table of contents for both the Blog
and Documentation archetypes through an event that runs at pre-render.
It also handles handing off and validating data between functional 
parts of the site.

## Options

This plugin does a number of things from filling in for markdown 
plugins that aren't compatible with the new MDX in Lume 3, to 
making sure all theme-specific data ends up where it needs to go.

There are some configurable options to control generation:

| Function | Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Configured Value |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| TOC | `toc_selector` | string | ID of the container where the generated TOC will land. | `#toc` | `#toc` |
| TOC | `toc_container` | string | Class name of the container to scan for headings. | `.toc-enabled` | `.toc-enabled` |
| TOC | `toc_heading_selectors` | string | Comma-separated list of headings to process. | `h2, h3, h4, h5, h6` | `h2, h3, h4, h5, h6` |
| TOC | `toc_list_class` | string | Class name to apply to the generated TOC list. | empty | `table-of-contents padding-top--none` |
| TOC | `toc_link_class` | string | Class name to apply to generated TOC links. | empty | `table-of-contents__link` |

And, here's how the plugin is loaded in the theme (from `plugins.ts`):

```js
  .use(conductor({
    // Container where the TOC is deposited once generated
    toc_selector: "#toc",
    // Content within this container is scanned for headings
    toc_container: ".toc-enabled",
    // Headings to scan for and extract / anchor 
    toc_heading_selectors: "h2, h3, h4, h5, h6",
    // class to apply to generated TOC links
    toc_link_class: "table-of-contents__link",
    // class to apply to generated TOC list
    toc_list_class: "table-of-contents padding-top--none",
  }))
```

## Table Of Contents Generation

A very basic TOC that gets generated automatically by heading tags found within the 
container element on the page. 

It goes by the `id=""` attribute to the heading tags, and creates one based on the 
depth of the document if one isn't supplied. Since markdown links don't provide a way 
to set this, just use the heading tag itself, e.g.:

```html
<h3 id="permanent-link">This will always be at #permanent-link</h3>
```

Remember, it's _all_ MDX, so don't fret the markup!

I'm really not interested in a TOC that does multi-depth lists as this list needs to be
compact. If you think of some clever way of not making it cluttered with additional
indentation and want to code up the css changes, send me a PR.

If you want to disable the TOC checking, just set the `toc_selector` value to an empty
string (`""`). I plan on adding per-page overriding in frontmatter sometime in the not 
too distant future, but not having the selector available is a very efficient way of 
disabling it per-page for now.

## Data Preprocessing

  - The plugin examines the `author` key, transforms spaces to dashes, 
    and then saves it as `safe_author` so it's easy to use without constantly 
    calling `.replace()` in templates.

  - The plugin will soon be generating a list of `waypoint` -> `archetype.basedir` indexes
    that is needed by `generators/_data.ts` to power the archive, tag and author page 
    generators independently per-install.

  - The plugin will be soon be generating a "global" tags file that will be used by the search 
    UI.

  - Most likely some kind of checks to catch common misconfiguration and warn with something 
    useful before undefined behavior happens.

## Roadmap

Anything that needs to be done through an event or on startup to make the theme
function properly can go in the conductor, that's what it's here for.
