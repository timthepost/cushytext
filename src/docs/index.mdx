# Current Status: <span class="text--danger">Incomplete</span>

Most things are fairly stable, but there's still a lot of finishing touches needed 
before I'm comfortable tagging in a release. 

***I expect the first testing release (`0.0.1-rc1`) to be ready around the first week of April, 2025.***

## Cloning & Starting Up Locally

The only way to check things out right now is to **[clone the repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext)**.

Once you have a working copy of the repo, the following sets `LUME_DRAFTS` true and starts the Lume 
local server:

```bash
> deno task dev
```

Look at `_includes/partials/head.vto` for Sa11y imports (used to test accessibility). Right now just 
comment / uncomment them. I plan to organize dev loading more around environmental variables soon.

There's also a special task for starting the production server (`src/_serve.ts`),
which you should only have to do if you're changing the server code or testing 
redirects:

```bash
> deno task mock
```

This starts the _production_ server locally, on port 8000, and then watches
the _server_ code (`_serve.ts`) for changes and reloads. This does not live-reload
_content_, just the server _itself_ if the server code changes.

Middleware works locally the same as remotely, you don't need this to test that. 
This option is here to debug changes to the server before pushing them, or
things like testing redirects.

<h2 id="current_focus">Current Focus (All must be done before `0.0.1` testing release)</h2>

 - Everything needed to be a remote theme (`mod.ts` for remote files, 
   `init.ts` to generate default content)

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.3`)</h2>

 - Re-doing the docs auto nav with the [Nav plugin](https://lume.land/plugins/nav/), 
   which I think also helps solve the nested sections and custom sidebar import 
   complications (though custom would have to follow the nav plugin output format).

 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.

 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.

 - More content-building components (tabs, responsive YT player helper, docs index
   page generator) Perhaps a selective generator for Discord Q&A as the start of a 
   FAQ component.

 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better (already started)

 - SEO Plugin v1 rewrite should be ready by then. The one soaking in `_plugins/seo`
   needs to be rewritten to accept lengths in chars or words, and to use the DOM API 
   instead of fiddling with frontmatter directly. It also needs to have a better 
   strategy for running on save events, current behavior scans all pages on every save.
   However, the tests themselves are sound. It works well.

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

I've set up a [low-volume Discord server](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH) to coordinate efforts. You can
also open an issue on Github for anything from reporting a bug to proposing
a new idea. If you prefer to communicate via email, I'm `tinkertim@gmail.com`.

Please ***expect frequent breaking changes***. I don't knowingly push bugs 
live, but it does happen - if it's still broken in a few days please open an 
issue.

Standard [contributing guidelines](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) apply.
