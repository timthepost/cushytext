# Status: <span class="text--danger">Incomplete & Unstable.</span>

_I'm building the site about Cushy Text with Cushy Text while I build Cushy 
Text. That's so ... meta._ 

I'm doing my best to keep this documentation up-to-date as I go from one breaking 
change to another. 

## Installing

For now: [just clone the repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext).

I'll have a `mod.ts` file and a generator to make some default content pages so that it 
works as a proper remote theme, but not until a lot more stuff is finished. Once you have 
he repo, the following sets `LUME_DRAFTS` true and starts the Lume local server:

```bash
$ deno task dev
```

There's also a special task for starting the production server (`src/_serve.ts`),
which you should only have to do if you're changing the server code or testing 
redirects:

```bash
$ deno task mock
```

This starts the _production_ server locally, on port 8000, and then watches
the _server_ code (`_serve.ts`) for changes and reloads. This does not live-reload
_content_, just the server _itself_ if the server code changes.

Middleware works locally the same as remotely, you don't need this to test that. 
This option is here to debug changes to the server before pushing them, or
things like testing redirects.

Also note you have two cleaning tasks available:

```bash
$ deno task clean
$ deno task maintainer-clean
```

The first one removes `_site` and local cache items, but does not remove `node_modules`; 
the second task will first run the first, and then also remove `node_modules`.

## Current Focus

 - Search! (See whole section below this one)

 - Docs auto nav doesn't deal with nested directories very well.

 - The conductor plugin needs to export a list of `waypoint -> folder`,
   and the reverse, so that it can be imported in `generators/_data.ts`.
   This is what's going to allow flexibility on how, when and where 
   tag and author archive pages are generated.

 - There should be some kind of `authors.yml` that contains at least a short
   biography and maybe even social links per-author. This isn't _just_ for 
   vanity, generated pages have no SEO value without content.

 - Similarly to `authors.yml`, we need `tagInfo.yml`, so that each tag can have 
   some content about what it's for. Some tags can obviously take more advantage 
   of this than others, but we should have it.

 - Blog & Docs sidebars don't collapse as well as they should: there should be 
   a TOC at the top of the post on small screens, with the one in the sidebar hidden
   (for both blogs and docs). Also make sure the rest of the stuff that ends up at 
   the bottom is necessary on small screens and use a media query to hide some of it.

 - See section about plugins below.

 - Make remote themes work with sparse initial content generated (two example 
   blog posts, three markdown document pages, one landing page).

 - Template markup has a lot of inline `style="..."` that could probably be put 
   into an actual class. There's also traces of "designed in place" style markup
   that should be refactored into a class. 

 - Aria labels, roles, tab indexes all need to be straightened out now that the 
   DOM is structurally more stable.

## Search 

Integrating Pagefind's UI into Infima's top nav architecture is just not going to
happen without breaking one or the other. That's actually not a big problem for 
me, because I want to do more than "just Pagefind" with a theme that's supposed
to be about managing text and interactive features.

The idea is, have any search input trigger an as-they-type set of results with an
easy way to expand results for advanced options. This will be powered by Router 
middleware and the Pagefind JS API, which can also do the job of mixing in other 
search sources (maybe from a main company site? an ad server? whatever, you do you!)

Results will then be returned according to tag preferences, and the UI does whatever 
is appropriate for the setting and screen size. Being able to offer complete 
search without the need for any third parties is a major goal for me.

That's the idea, anyway. The very first version may just open a modal any time a
search box gets focus and show the default Pagefind UI - if that's all that's holding
up a release. But I'm still doing the back-end search no matter what.

## Plugins

I'm not out to make a "kitchen sink" theme, but there are a number of plugins that I 
consider pretty essential for a performant, convenient and discoverable site. Those
three things are equally important to me when I work.

I'm the author and maintainer of the `seo` and `conductor` plugins, which are Included
and enabled (the conductor is actually required).

The rest of these are official Lume plugins that, due to their nature, can't all be
installed and enabled because they can hide subtle development issues. To keep track
of all that are installed, and all that still need to be enabled, I've created the 
following table:

### List & Status Of All Planned Plugins:

Those listed as `No` are either being left out deliberately for now 
due to development, or require some effort to include properly.
