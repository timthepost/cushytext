# Current Status: <span class="text--danger">Alpha</span>

I'm building the site about Cushy Text with Cushy Text while I build Cushy Text.

You can't get any more meta than that. Well, I guess you could, but let's get to
the point - ***Cushy Text Is About 45% Baked***. Here's a list of things that, 
while ever-changing, is currently the best roadmap.

The theme is fine to play with, but it's not ready for any kind of serious 
use yet.

## Installing 

The easiest way to use the theme is to clone the git repository, for now.

Eventually, it will be a remote theme anyone can use when they initialize
Lume.

## Current Focus

Right now I'm working on finishing the blog archetype with a nice archive
page, tag and author pages, and working pagination / forward / next links.

After that, the documentation archetype needs pagination / forward / next 
links. Creating re-usable components through this process is part of the 
process.

There are also a lot of plugins that have to be installed and configured
to work with everything else (OG Image, Image Resizing, Optimization & 
minimizing, etc.)

## Known Issues

 - Lume TOC plugins don't yet work with the new SSX flavor of MDX. I expect
   this to change before Lume3 is officially released.

 - Code highlighting plugins don't yet work with the new SSX flavor of MDX. Like
   the TOC issue, I expect this to be fixed before Lume3, so I'm not doing anything
   to work around it.

## Two Column Design For Most Things

Originally we had a 3-column left sidebar, a 6-column center content 
area, and then a 3-column right sidebar. This is the classic "Infima"
look that people are used to.

A single sidebar that can move to the responsive flyout "hamburger"
menu quickly surfaced as the most logical way forward, so that's what
was used.

If you want to go back to three columns, you'll need to edit the 
template, and have it look something like this (and this is just
using Infama's [grid system](https://infima.dev/docs/layout/grid)):

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col col--3">
            <!-- left nav goes here -->
        </div>
        <div class="col col--6">
            <!-- content goes here -->
        </div>
        <div class="col col--3">
            <!-- right nav goes here -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

You could also experiment with different sizes, just remember it
all has to add up to 12 columns. To make the content 8 columns, you'd
have to steal a column from both sidebars, for instance, or remove one.

## Search 

Search will use Pagefind like most other Lume sites, but it will be 
implemented a little differently:

 - Search gets submitted to an async middlware function that uses the
   Pagefind API under the hood.

 - This function also uses Lume's comprehensive tag search to help with
   results.

 - 100% of the search experience is customizeable. If you wanted to, say,
   also pull in results from Elastic or other providers, you could easily 
   do so in the middlware (see `/src/_server_routes.ts`)

For the first version, it's very likely that a modal will open when the
nav searchbar has focus, which just uses the Pagefind UI. Hopefully the
full stack search will be done by then, but if not, we can still launch
everything else.
