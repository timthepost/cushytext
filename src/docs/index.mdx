# Status: <span class="text--danger">Incomplete & Unstable.</span>

_I'm building the site about Cushy Text with Cushy Text while I build Cushy 
Text. That's so ... meta._ 

I'm doing my best to keep this documentation up-to-date as I go from one breaking 
change to another. 

## Installing

For now: [just clone the repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext).

I'll have a `mod.ts` file and a generator to make some default content pages so that it 
works as a proper remote theme, but not until a lot more stuff is finished. Once you have 
he repo, the following sets `LUME_DRAFTS` true and starts the Lume local server:

```bash
$ deno task dev
```

There's also a special task for starting the production server (`src/_serve.ts`),
which you should only have to do if you're changing the server code or testing 
redirects:

```bash
$ deno task mock
```

This starts the _production_ server locally, on port 8000, and then watches
the _server_ code (`_serve.ts`) for changes and reloads. 

Middleware works locally the same as remotely, you don't need this to test that. 
This option is here to debug changes to the server before pushing them, or
things like testing redirects.

Also note you have two cleaning tasks available:

```bash
$ deno task clean
$ deno task maintainer-clean
```

The first one removes `_site` and local cache items, but does not remove `node_modules`; 
the second task will first run the first, and then also remove `node_modules`.

## Current Focus

 - Re-designing archetype tags like `%blog%` to be something called _waypoints_
   instead, which won't pollute `tags` but still provide the same functionality 
   when it comes to scoping individual archetype installations expressively. See
   the note at the top of the [archetypes docs](/docs/archetypes/).

 - Search! (See whole section below this one)

 - Docs auto nav doesn't deal with nested directories very well.

 - A long list of additional plugins, like the OG Image Generator, need 
   installed, configured, tested and tweaked.

 - Make remote themes work with sparse initial content generated (two example 
   blog posts, three markdown document pages, one landing page).

 - Template markup has a lot of inline `style="..."` that smells. Most places
   where that's found need refactored and proper classes.

 - Aria labels, roles, tab indexes all need to be straightened out now that the 
   DOM is structurally more stable.

## Search 

Integrating Pagefind's UI into Infima's top nav architecture is just not going to
happen without breaking one or the other. That's actually not a big problem for 
me, because I want to do more than "just Pagefind" with a theme that's supposed
to be about managing text and interactive features.

The idea is, have any search input trigger an as-they-type set of results with an
easy way to expand results for advanced options. This will be powered by Router 
middleware and the Pagefind JS API, which can also do the job of mixing in other 
search sources (maybe from a main company site? an ad server? whatever, you do you!)

Results will then be returned according to tag preferences, and the UI does whatever 
is appropriate for the setting and screen size. Being able to offer complete 
search without the need for any third parties is a major goal for me.

That's the idea, anyway. The very first version may just open a modal any time a
search box gets focus and show the default Pagefind UI - if that's all that's holding
up a release. But I'm still doing the back-end search no matter what.
