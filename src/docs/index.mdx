# Current Status: <span class="text--danger">Incomplete</span>

The site builds, things are fairly stable and the blog and docs sections are mostly 
functional, but not all features work yet. Additionally, there's no 
`mod.ts` or `init.ts` yet to provide a "bare" version of the theme, so the only way to 
work with it is to clone this entire site. Interactive features haven't been added yet, 
and there's still some work on design components that needs to happen first.

***I expect the first testing release (`0.0.1-rc1`) to be ready around the first week of April, 2025.***

## Cloning & Starting Up Locally

The only way to check things out right now is to **[clone the repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext)**.

_Please_ keep in mind that this project is very much a moving target
right now, and many things are the way that they are just because that's 
how they exist at the moment. While the design and functionality are 
pretty well laid out, how things work, are worded, ordered, etc is still
a major work-in-progress. Likewise, only start something long-term with this
if you know what you're doing.

Once you have a working copy of the repo, the following sets `LUME_DRAFTS` true and starts the Lume 
local server:

```bash
$ deno task dev
```

There's also a special task for starting the production server (`src/_serve.ts`),
which you should only have to do if you're changing the server code or testing 
redirects:

```bash
$ deno task mock
```

This starts the _production_ server locally, on port 8000, and then watches
the _server_ code (`_serve.ts`) for changes and reloads. This does not live-reload
_content_, just the server _itself_ if the server code changes.

Middleware works locally the same as remotely, you don't need this to test that. 
This option is here to debug changes to the server before pushing them, or
things like testing redirects.

<h2 id="current_focus">Current Focus (All must be done before `0.0.1` testing release)</h2>

 - Everything needed to be a remote theme (`mod.ts` for remote files, 
   `init.ts` to generate default content)

 - Aria labels, roles, tab indexes all need to be straightened out now that the 
   DOM is structurally more stable.
 
 - Interactive Features (start with docs rating), see also `_cms.ts` for back-end.

 - Need a `/types.ts` to export types for interactive features & other stuff.

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.3`)</h2>

 - Re-doing the docs auto nav with the [Nav plugin](https://lume.land/plugins/nav/), 
   which I think also helps solve the nested sections and custom sidebar import 
   complications (though custom would have to follow the nav plugin output format).

 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.

 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.

 - Finish porting all the components to Lume 3 structure.

 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better (already started)

 - SEO Plugin v1 should be ready by then.


<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

I've set up a [low-volume Discord server](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH) to coordinate efforts. You can
also open an issue on Github for anything from reporting a bug to proposing
a new idea. If you prefer to communicate via email, I'm `tinkertim@gmail.com`.

Please ***expect frequent breaking changes***. I don't knowingly push bugs 
live, but it does happen - if it's still broken in a few days please open an 
issue.

Standard [contributing guidelines](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) apply.
