# Welcome to your documentation Index Page!

You'll probably want to replace this with something fancy. Also,
all those links to the left, in the sidebar? They exist to show 
you how auto generation works. Each one is a file (or folder)
within `{docs.basedir}`, or <code>{docs.basedir}</code>.

## A primer on how "docs" and sidebars currently work:

To start with, it doesn't have to be named `/docs`! It could be 
`/documentation` or whatever you like, or you can remove it completely. What
makes it behave like a documentation site is the  `_data.yml` file in the 
{docs.basedir} directory with your documentation, which is what makes it all work:

`docs/_data.yml`: 

```yml
layout: layouts/docupage.vto
docs:
  basedir: /docs/
  title: Documentation Home
  sidebar: auto
```

Line by line, we have:

 - The template used to generate docs-style pages, which you can 
 modify in `src/_includes/layouts/docupage.vto`. 

 - `docs.basedir` sets the root of the documentation instance, which 
 is used to anchor the auto auto nav generation, among other things. This 
 should always match the directory that you use for documentation.s

 - The `docs.title` setting controls the top named anchor in the 
 nav. This is a temporary work-around while a smarter nav generator
 is being developed.

 - The  `docs.sidebar` setting controls whether the docs pages nav
 should be automatically generated. If it's set to `auto`, the nav
 will be automatically generated. Soon, this setting will allow you
 to pass a custom sidebar object.

As for the docs pages, the individual frontmatter settings that are most 
relevant to this archetype aren't in the `docs` space, but in the main 
page frontmatter:

```yml
---
order: 1
hidden: false
draft: false
---
```

 - `order` is numeric and controls which place the link should appear 
 in the nav.

 - `hidden` allows the page to be generated, but keeps it out of the
 generated nav.

 - `draft` does not generate the page at all unless `LUME_DRAFTS` is 
 set in the environment.

With these settings, you get an experience that's relatively close to 
other documentation generation themes. However, for right now: ***Any 
and all of this is subject to change, because the nav code is probably 
the most actively-moving target right now.*** Nav is one of those things 
that's easy to get 80% of the way through only to realize your approach 
is wrong and was never going to work to begin with. Ask me how I know 
sometime!

## Coming Soon: Auto TOC, Breadcrumbs, Next / Prev & Custom Sidebars

AutoTOC will happen through the community plugin once the rest of the
generated navigation is sorted out.

Next and prev links aren't yet auto-generated. I'm currently working
on the whole site nav via Lume's `site.search()`. Once that's done 
then we'll use  nav.breadcrumbs()` for the next/prev links, which 
are hopefully turned into components by then.

There is also the need to get everything important in the docs sidebar
into the sub-menu of the responsive flyout nav menu. That means, by the 
time this template is even loaded, we should already have sorted nav objects
to iterate over.

## Tags Will Work Too

Tags will work on every archetype, and be namespaced independently, but 
in a way that they can be linked together when needed (e.g. search). Tags
will be a big part of both site search and SEO strategy, and have a 
separate plugin orchestrating them: `_plugins/cushy-docs-conductor`.

Use them how you normally would in frontmatter, the 'extra' features and 
rendering fill follow soon.

## Two Column Design 

Originally we had a 3-column left sidebar, a 6-column center content 
area, and then a 3-column right sidebar. That may be the "classic"
look, but ended up being a giant waste of space in this setting.

Because docs, blog and content pages all have to fold neatly into 
the responsive left-side nav, staying with two-columns and just 
having the TOC and Nav share the same sidebar made the most sense.

If you want to go back to three columns, you'll need to edit the 
template, and have it look something like this (and this is just
using Infama's [grid system](https://infima.dev/docs/layout/grid)):

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <!-- left nav goes here -->
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <!-- content goes here -->
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <!-- right nav goes here -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Just remember, all the nav has to exist in the responsive flyout too, 
which keeps things interesting.

You could also experiment with different sizes, just remember it
all has to add up to 12 columns. To make the content 8 columns, you'd
have to steal a column from both sidebars, for instance.

Once sort order is all ironed out, the top and hamburger navs will be 
auto generated, as well as the footer.

## Search 

Search will be global (just use `data-pagefind` as usual), but it will 
be powered by some middleware that uses the Pagefind API to get its 
own results, so it controls its own styles and integrates tags properly.

To get a version-0 out, I may just modal the Pagefind div, depends on 
how things are when it ships in a month or so.
