# Welcome to your /docs Index Page!

You'll probably want to replace this with something fancy. Also,
all those links? They exist to show you how auto generation works.

## A primer on how /docs currently works:

This page is just here as a quick primer for what works.
Currently, `/docs` has the following data (from `docs/_data.yml`):

```yml
layout: layouts/docupage.vto
docs_basedir: /docs/
docs_title: Documentation Home
docs_sidebar: auto
```

The `layout` is what loads the docs template. You can modify it however
you like. The `docs_basedir` value is important because it tells the nav
generator where to anchor itself. `docs_title` is how the top level 
nav link to the docs folder should appear.

Finally, `sidebar` can either be `auto` (default) which auto-generates a
basic but very flat sidebar navigation link structure.

## Custom sidebars, sort order and TOC coming soon

You can soon pass a custom sidebar as the value for `sidebar`. This 
will be available once the existing auto generation is broken out into 
its own template. Not sure if .json or .vto at this point.

There should also be some kind of sort order for the way the nav is 
built, which is planned but not urgent.

TOC will go on the left, which makes it all easier to vanish ito the 
hamburger.

## Bottom next / prev not yet functional

Possible with `nav.breadcrumbs()` I think, but still just prototype HTML.

## Changed from 3 to 2 column

It just made more sense. The third column only had the TOC, which can be 
floated or just kept on the left sidebar.
