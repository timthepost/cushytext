# Current Status: <span class="text--success">Launching Soon!</span>

Things are at a point where I'd say they're ready. You can head over to 
the [new repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext-theme) now if you
want!

I'll be tagging in a release there soon mostly for the benefit _of the SEO plugin_, 
which can be (and is being) tested in a stand-alone way right now. The theme itself
will launch and appear on the Lume themes page a couple of weeks after Lume 3 
releases.

There will be a blog post (relatively) soon when the plugin opens for testing, and
then again when the theme is listed on lume.land/themes/ and can be installed via
CLI. No additional features are planned until after release of everything, just 
bug fixes and updates in reaction to any changes in Lume 3.

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.3`)</h2>
 - Re-doing the docs auto nav with the [Nav plugin](https://lume.land/plugins/nav/), 
   which I think also helps solve the nested sections and custom sidebar import 
   complications (though custom would have to follow the nav plugin output format).
   **Docs currently does not handle nested directories very well with the way it 
   generates navigation (or headings, in general)**.
 - More robust archetype scripts and CMS integration.
 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.
 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.
 - More content-building components (tabs, responsive YT player helper, docs index
   page generator) Perhaps a selective generator for Discord Q&A as the start of a 
   FAQ component.
 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better (already started)

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

I've set up a [low-volume Discord server](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH) to coordinate efforts. You can
also open an issue on Github for anything from reporting a bug to proposing
a new idea. If you prefer to communicate via email, I'm `tinkertim@gmail.com`.

Please ***expect frequent breaking changes***. I don't knowingly push bugs 
live, but it does happen - if it's still broken in a few days please open an 
issue.

Standard [contributing guidelines](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) apply.
