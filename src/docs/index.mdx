# Welcome To Your /docs Index Page!

This is some content. Obviously, some more media queries
and thought into design is needed here. Should make the 
left nav a child of the hamburger one?

Perhaps a two-column design for `docs` is better, 
where the side begins with "on this page .." then the TOC,
then "In this collection" with the docs nav.

This then becomes the hamburger "child" nav (with a Link
back to the main hamburger nav)?

I like option 2 better so far. Thinking about it.
