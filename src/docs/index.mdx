# Current Status: <span class="text--danger">Incomplete</span>

The site builds, things are fairly stable and the blog and docs sections are mostly 
functional, but not all features (like search) work yet. Additionally, there's no 
`mod.ts` or `init.ts` yet to provide a "bare" version of the theme, so the only way to 
work with it is to clone this entire site. Interactive features haven't been added yet, 
and there's still some work on design components that needs to happen first.

***I expect the first testing release (`0.0.1-rc1`) to be ready around the first week of April, 2025.***

## Cloning & Starting Up Locally

The only way to check things out right now is to **[clone the repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext)**.

_Please_ keep in mind that this project is very much a moving target
right now, and many things are the way that they are just because that's 
how they exist at the moment. While the design and functionality are 
pretty well laid out, how things work, are worded, ordered, etc is still
a major work-in-progress. Likewise, only start something long-term with this
if you know what you're doing.

Once you have a working copy of the repo, the following sets `LUME_DRAFTS` true and starts the Lume 
local server:

```bash
$ deno task dev
```

There's also a special task for starting the production server (`src/_serve.ts`),
which you should only have to do if you're changing the server code or testing 
redirects:

```bash
$ deno task mock
```

This starts the _production_ server locally, on port 8000, and then watches
the _server_ code (`_serve.ts`) for changes and reloads. This does not live-reload
_content_, just the server _itself_ if the server code changes.

Middleware works locally the same as remotely, you don't need this to test that. 
This option is here to debug changes to the server before pushing them, or
things like testing redirects.

<h2 id="current_focus">Current Focus (All must be done before `0.0.1` testing release)</h2>

 - Search! (See whole section below this one)

 - Everything needed to be a remote theme (`mod.ts` for remote files, 
   `init.ts` to generate default content)

 - Aria labels, roles, tab indexes all need to be straightened out now that the 
   DOM is structurally more stable.
 
 - Interactive Features (start with docs rating), see also `_cms.ts` for back-end.

 - Need a `/types.ts` to export types for interactive features & other stuff.

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.3`)</h2>

 - Re-doing the docs auto nav with the [Nav plugin](https://lume.land/plugins/nav/), 
   which I think also helps solve the nested sections and custom sidebar import 
   complications (though custom would have to follow the nav plugin output format).

 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.

 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.

 - Finish porting all the components to Lume 3 structure.

 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better.

 - SEO Plugin v1 should be ready by then.

## Status Of Search:

Pagefind (even if you tweak every CSS element it uses) just does _not_ integrate
well into the Infima nav bar without breaking either Pagefind or Infima. To get 
around this, I plan to put the Pagefind search div in a modal that opens when 
the navigation bar gets focus. Similar to how lume.land does it with Algolia.

***However, and this is a big however ...***

I don't want to leave it at "just pagefind" even though that alone is already
quite good. People often want to be able to bring in more sources, or create 
feeds from searches - these are things we could do if searches went through
the Router middleware. Middleware can talk to the Pagefind JS API directly, 
`fetch()` anything else that might be relevant from, say, your main site,
do any additional merging and return a nice result array, with a UI that 
allows for more filtering options.

In order to ship, and for probably the first couple of versions, it'll just
be Pagefind in a modal. But I don't want to lose traction on the idea of 
implementing search in a more integrator-friendly way.


<h2 id="plugin-status">Status Of Included Plugins:</h2>

As of now, all plugins are installed, configured and working properly. The
table below shows the status of what's included, as well as which ones have
custom configurations in order to perform optimally in this theme:

***This list is unlikely to change.***

Order of plugin loading matters considerably more in Lume 3, which is 
what Cushy Text is being built on. Right now, the project is working
on making sure all _currently_ installed plugins are configured to 
work optimally together. Adding another  plugin that affects output
in any way would just complicate the last stages of development for 
the first release.

If you _really_ think I missed one that should _absolutely_ be part
of the very first release, please find me on the Cushy Text Discord
(link in footer) and let me know, or open a GH issue.

Speaking of issues ...

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

I've set up a [low-volume Discord server](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH) to coordinate efforts. You can
also open an issue on Github for anything from reporting a bug to proposing
a new idea. If you prefer to communicate via email, I'm `tinkertim@gmail.com`.

Please ***expect frequent breaking changes***. I don't knowingly push bugs 
live, but it does happen - if it's still broken in a few days please open an 
issue.
