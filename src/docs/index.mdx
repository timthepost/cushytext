# Current Status: <span class="text--success">Launching Soon!</span>

Things are pretty stable, it's time to cut a release people can update from. It's also time
for this repo to just be for `cushytext.deno.dev` and release the theme from a brand new 
repo of its own!

***I still expect the first testing release (`0.0.1-rc1`) to be ready around the 
first week of April, 2025. Here's a [release plan](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext/blob/main/RELEASE-TODO.md) 
(Github Link) for the release, and how the transition away from this current repo will work.***

You're still welcome to [clone the development repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext),
but understand that you're getting a whole copy of this site, and development is moving to an 
entirely new repository on release. This lets me do my own thing on top of the base
template, too, and sets me up to be downstream from my own changes, which is good as they'll 
affect me just like they affect everyone else.

<h2 id="current_focus">Current Focus (All must be done before `0.0.1` testing release)</h2>
 - Everything needed to be a remote theme (`mod.ts` for remote files, 
   `init.ts` to generate default content) (see release plan link above)
 - The SEO plugin still needs some love:
    - Lengths should be able to be specified as characters or words.
    - It should use Lume's provided `page.document` object where possible 
      to run checks.
    - It should be able to look at only modified files on save events, 
      inspecting all files only on startup? Nice to have.
- The archetype scripts need some attention.

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.3`)</h2>
 - Re-doing the docs auto nav with the [Nav plugin](https://lume.land/plugins/nav/), 
   which I think also helps solve the nested sections and custom sidebar import 
   complications (though custom would have to follow the nav plugin output format).
   **Docs currently does not handle nested directories very well with the way it 
   generates navigation (or headings, in general)**.
 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.
 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.
 - More content-building components (tabs, responsive YT player helper, docs index
   page generator) Perhaps a selective generator for Discord Q&A as the start of a 
   FAQ component.
 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better (already started)
 - SEO Plugin v1 rewrite should be ready by then. The one soaking in `_plugins/seo`
   needs to be rewritten to accept lengths in chars or words, and to use the DOM API 
   instead of fiddling with frontmatter directly. It also needs to have a better 
   strategy for running on save events, current behavior scans all pages on every save.
   However, the tests themselves are sound. It works well.

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

I've set up a [low-volume Discord server](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH) to coordinate efforts. You can
also open an issue on Github for anything from reporting a bug to proposing
a new idea. If you prefer to communicate via email, I'm `tinkertim@gmail.com`.

Please ***expect frequent breaking changes***. I don't knowingly push bugs 
live, but it does happen - if it's still broken in a few days please open an 
issue.

Standard [contributing guidelines](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) apply.
