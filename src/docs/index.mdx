# Current Status: <span class="text--danger">Alpha & Unstable.</span>

I'm building the site about Cushy Text with Cushy Text while I build Cushy 
Text. That's so ... meta. I'm doing my best to keep this documentation up-to-date
as I go from one breaking change to another. 

## Installing

<span class="text--danger">
  <strong>
    This is not yet ready for any kind of serious use. Expect breaking changes daily.
  </strong>
</span>

For now: [just clone the repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext).

I'll have a `mod.ts` file and a generator to make some default content pages so that it 
works as a proper remote theme, but not until a lot more stuff is finished. Once you have 
he repo, the following sets `LUME_DRAFTS` true and starts the Lume local server:

```bash
$ deno task dev
```

There's also a special task for starting the production server (`src/_serve.ts`),
which you should only have to do if you're changing the server code or testing 
redirects:

```bash
$ deno task mock
```

This starts the _production_ server locally, on port 8000, and then watches
the _server_ code (`_serve.ts`) for changes and reloads. 

Middleware works locally the same as remotely, you don't need this to test that. 
This option is here to debug changes to the server before pushing them, or
things like testing redirects.

Also note you have two cleaning tasks available:

```bash
$ deno task clean
$ deno task maintainer-clean
```

The first one removes `_site` and local cache items, but does not remove `node_modules`; 
the second task will first run the first, and then also remove `node_modules`.

## Current Focus

 - Blog / Tag archive pages need some love under each heading result:
    - Show meta description as a teaser text.
    - Show tags
    - Show date & author
    - Show reading time

 - The `_data/navbar.yml` file controls the static navigation, which is
   the main top navbar, and the main section of the fly-out nav. It also
   needs to control the footer. Everything else is auto-generated.

 - Docs auto nav doesn't deal with nested directories very well.

 - A long list of additional plugins, like the OG Image Generator, need 
   installed, configured, tested and tweaked.

 - I also need to finish the open dyslexic font switcher.

 - Make remote themes work with sparse initial content generated (two example 
   blog posts, three markdown document pages, one landing page).

 - Template markup has a lot of inline `style="..."` that smells. Most places
   where that's found need refactored and proper classes.

 - Aria labels, roles, tab indexes all need to be straightened out now that the 
   DOM is structurally more stable.
