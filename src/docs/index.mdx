# Welcome to your /docs Index Page!

You'll probably want to replace this with something fancy. Also,
all those links? They exist to show you how auto generation works.

## A primer on how /docs sidebars currently work:

Currently, `/docs` has the following config, in `docs/_data.yml`:

```yml
layout: layouts/docupage.vto
docs_basedir: /docs/
docs_title: Documentation Home
docs_sidebar: auto
```

You can have a diferent `_data.yml` in each folder inside `docs_basedir`, if 
you want to control sidebars individually. Or you can pass a custom sidebar
file as the value of `docs_sidebar` (coming soon)

The `layout` is what loads the docs template. You can modify it however
you like. The `docs_basedir` value is important because it tells the nav
generator where to anchor itself. `docs_title` is how the top level 
nav link to the docs folder should appear.

## Custom sidebars, sort order and TOC coming soon.

Unsure if the custom value will accept JSON, a template file, or both.
Still deciding on that. 

There should also be some kind of sort order for the way the nav is 
built, which is planned but not urgent.

Finally, the TOC will go on the left, which makes it all easier to vanish 
ito the hamburger.

## Bottom next / prev not yet functional.

Possible with `nav.breadcrumbs()` I think, but still just prototype HTML.

## Changed from 3 to 2 column design.

Originally, it was modeled after Docusaurus. But two columns just made more
sense. The third column only had the TOC, which can be floated or just kept 
on the left sidebar. 

We're not Docusaurus, after all :)
