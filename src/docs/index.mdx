# Current Status: <span class="text--danger">Incomplete</span>

The site builds, things are fairly stable and the blog and docs sections are mostly 
functional, but not all features (like search) work yet. Additionally, there's no 
`mod.ts` or `init.ts` yet to provide a "bare" version of the theme, so the only way to 
work with it is to clone this entire site. 

## Cloning & Starting Lume

There's no remote-file support yet, or theme initializer, so the only way to 
check things out right now is to **[clone the repo](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext)**.
Be advised that scripts and template files are prone to _frequent_ updates right 
now, so be careful doing anything more than poking around.

Once you have a working copy of the repo, the following sets `LUME_DRAFTS` true and starts the Lume 
local server:

```bash
$ deno task dev
```

There's also a special task for starting the production server (`src/_serve.ts`),
which you should only have to do if you're changing the server code or testing 
redirects:

```bash
$ deno task mock
```

This starts the _production_ server locally, on port 8000, and then watches
the _server_ code (`_serve.ts`) for changes and reloads. This does not live-reload
_content_, just the server _itself_ if the server code changes.

Middleware works locally the same as remotely, you don't need this to test that. 
This option is here to debug changes to the server before pushing them, or
things like testing redirects.

<h2 id="current_focus">Current Focus (All must be done before `0.0.1` testing release)</h2>

 - Search! (See whole section below this one)

 - See section about plugins below.

 - Everything needed to be a remote theme (`mod.ts` for remote files, 
   `init.ts` to generate default content)

 - Aria labels, roles, tab indexes all need to be straightened out now that the 
   DOM is structurally more stable.
 
 - Interactive Features (start with docs rating), see also `_cms.ts` for back-end.

 - Need a `/types.ts` to export types for interactive features & other stuff.

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.3`)</h2>

 - Docs needs a custom sidebar option in order to deal with nested directories.
   This can be done like simple wiki, with custom HTML elements, or even done 
   client-side. It's not possible to do with internal search alone.

 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.

 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.

 - Finish porting all the components to Lume 3 structure.

 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better.

 - SEO Plugin v1 should be ready by then.

## Status Of Search:

Integrating Pagefind's UI into Infima's top nav architecture is just not going to
happen without breaking one or the other. That's actually not a big problem for 
me, because I want to do more than "just Pagefind" with a theme that's supposed
to be about managing text and interactive features.

The idea is, have any search input trigger an as-they-type set of results with an
easy way to expand results for advanced options. This will be powered by Router 
middleware and the Pagefind JS API, which can also do the job of mixing in other 
search sources (maybe from a main company site? an ad server? whatever, you do you!)

Results will then be returned according to tag preferences, and the UI does whatever 
is appropriate for the setting and screen size. Being able to offer complete 
search without the need for any third parties is a major goal for me.

That's the idea, anyway. The very first version may just open a modal any time a
search box gets focus and show the default Pagefind UI - if that's all that's holding
up a release. But I'm still doing the back-end search no matter what.
