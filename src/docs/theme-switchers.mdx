# What are data-theme and data-font? 

At the right of the top navigation bar, there are two switches, 
one that toggles light and dark mode, and another that toggles
between the default system font and a user-preferred font, which
in this case is OpenDyslexic.

This is designed to help you understand how they are set so you 
don't have to do a lot of digging. 

In `src/_includes/js/main.js` there are events that run when the
buttons are clicked, which toggles the theme or the font. The 
preference is stored in local storage, and synchronized when the
document loads. There's also a dictionary to translate `system` to 
the default Infima font family, and `user` to OpenDyslexic, in
case you want to change the font it toggles.

## Working With Light / Dark Mode In CSS

Sometimes, you need to adjust how something looks when dark mode 
is on. In order to scope that, use `data-theme`, e.g:

```css {
.foo {
    color: blue;
    margin: 1rem;
}

[data-theme="dark"]
    .foo {
        color: red;
    }
}
```

You can find a list of default color variables for both light and
dark mode in `src/_includes/css/theme-variables.css`.

## Adjusting CSS Automatically For Font Changes

Much like dark mode, larger fonts with thicker borders tend to wreak
unanticipated havoc. Sometimes you want a slightly larger `min-height`
or perhaps less padding. This is possible in a similar way to scoping
the theme, except we're going by the font value.

Here's an example from the [front page of this site](/) where the cards
line up under the hero:

```css
/* Example of adapting design to a font-switch */
.homepage_card {
  min-height: 275px;
}

[data-font="user"] {
  .homepage_card {
    min-height: 365px;
  }
}
```

Otherwise, the page would not transform well when switched.
