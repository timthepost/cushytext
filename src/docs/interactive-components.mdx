I plan several interactive touches brought in through a few different
ways you can spice up a static site. Here are the ones I have deployed: 

## Content Usefulness Survey 

On the right-sidebar of every document page, you'll see a little widget
that lets you express how you feel about spending whatever time it took
to read that page.

That widget uses the Router middleware to process the form submission 
and insert the feedback into a DenoKV database, Discord channel, or 
anything else that can take input from a call to `fetch()`.

You can use it in a template like this:

```js
{{ await comp.feedback({ basename: url })}}
```
or in a MDX post (blog / docs) like this:

```js
<comp.feedback basename={url} />
```

The `basename` variable is used literally as _the base name_ of the key
that gets created to store the feedback entry. It's indexed by type, 
url. If using the redirects plugin, use the _oldest_ URL of the
group.

## Date Server

The economy "Is my site up and responding?" is found by sending a 
[request to /api](/api) which gets you a Javascript timestamp. Its there
to show an example route, and just because.
