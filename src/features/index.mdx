# {title}

The developer of this theme worked in the technology industry, in a position
known as Developer Relations. In early-stage startup companies, the "DevRel" 
usually gets the honor of owning ***all*** of the documentation, and this 
theme was made out of the experiences of helping companies get set up.

This theme is designed for anyone who has to deal with a large amount of 
text content, who is comfortable working with Markdown, and is adventurous 
enough to try some components to ease the workload.

These are the _main_ features, though there are perks built into unexpected
places.

<h2 id="documentation">A Mini Documentation Engine</h2>

Not as fully-featured as other software that uses the same CSS framework, but 
more than adequate to organize a few directories of documentation with independent
feeds and automatic layouts / sidebar generation.

This is a work-in-progress, but already captures the essence of what I hoped to 
accomplish in a single theme / design umbrella. 

<h2 id="Fully Featured Blog">Fully Featured Blog</h2>

Complete with archives, feeds, tags with community-editable tag wiki, MDX and 
everything else you need to get your writing in front of your audience. The 
theme will soon support multiple, completely independent but globally searchable
blogs and documentation instances. 

<h2 id="responsive">Responsive &amp; Accessible</h2>

Infima makes creating 100% responsive themes easier than many frameworks, because it
mostly handles it behind the scenes for you. The theme includes Infima CSS plus a 
style sheet for overrides and some classes to make everything work. Content looks
great on screens of all sizes.

This theme also features light and dark themes with auto detection, the ability to 
toggle [Open Dyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org) for long blocks of content, which
you can apply by just adding a `font-selectable` class to the text container.

There's still some labels and roles to sort out in the early version, as the structure
settles down, but accessibility and responsiveness are major goals.

<h2 id="interactive">Includes Interactive Features!</h2>

When it ships, it will come with features that get user feedback and store it in a 
DenoKV database. Things that ask _Did this help you?_ with the option to add 
free-form feedback. This is powered by the new Router middleware in Lume 3, so no 
edge functions are needed!

Check out the [blog update about additional features](/blog/interactive-feature-plans/) that are likely to also ship
with the early release candidates!

<h2 id="localization">Ready For Translation</h2>

No localization plugin has been installed _yet_, but all strings have been separated into 
two different locale files: `locale.yml` and `demo.yml`, located in the main `_data/`
directory. 

The `locale.yml` file contains strings that you're probably going to keep no matter how much
you customize the template. That's the file you should build on and take time to curate.

The other file `demo.yml` contains all the strings that make _this_ website's features work,
like the front page cards and such. Do whatever you want with those, they were kept out because
they would most likely be noise for translators.

<h2 id="components">Includes Infima Design Components</h2>

Take a look at [the Infima documentation site](https://infima.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction) 
to see everything included with the framework. You have everything from a grid and 
markup-friendly spacing system to alerts and buttons, pills, tabs and many other
components that technical / text sites need.

_Many_ of those components are also in the process of becoming Lume 3 components, which
will allow new sites to load only the CSS and JS they need from the framework as components
insert it through being used. Sites that already use component markup everywhere are also
fine, both ways work.

<h2 id="plugins">Includes A Ton Of Pre-Configured Plugins!</h2>

Everything from automatic OG image generation to broken link detection and plenty of 
optimization. Have a look at the [docs](/docs/#plugin-status) to see more about
what's shipping under the hood.
