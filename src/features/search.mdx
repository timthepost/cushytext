# Search With Batteries Included! Eventually.

Talk about how we're using Pagefind, but via the API through middleware that
also implements more tag options in search, and gives us total control of the
search UX. We still use a combination of Pagefind + Lume's `search.pages()`, 
it's just resturned via `fetch()` to the middleware.

Tag filtering with markdown syntax will eventually be supported.

## Tags, Tag Info Pages & Tag Markdown Extensions

It will be possible to create links to tag searches and info pages through 
markdown syntax like `[Link Text](docs-tag:foo)`, or `[javascript](blog-tag:js)`,
or even globally: `[everything on python](site-tags:python)`.

## Tag SEO Opportunities

Tag info pages allow you to gain additional indexed pages relevant to your
most frequent topics. Plans to automatically prepend relevant tags to titles that contain
a low percentage of uncommon words and other smart features are on the drawing board.
