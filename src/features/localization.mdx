# Ready For Translation!

While it does not (yet) ship with a multi-language plugin configured
and installed, Cushy Text is ready for translation.

## Locale And Demo Strings 

I've done my best to keep all strings that define the site navigation,
architecture, and sections into a YAML file found in `src/_data/locale.yml`.
This includes things like "Previous", "Next", "Archive" and those sorts 
of things. I've tried to keep the context as specific as I can with area
and variable names. 

There's also `demo.yml` in the same directory, which is what contains 
all of _this site's_ strings and content customizations outside of 
markdown files.

Both files ship by default, but `demo` is only included so you have 
a base from which to edit and create your own navigation and setup.

## I Also Welcome Translations

If you're interested in translating _this_ site, or helping with a 
default multi-language setup, feel free to reach out to me on Discord
or GH!
