# {title}

As a disabled person, accessibility matters a lot to me. It feels
bad when you know that, with not a lot of effort, web sites could be
making your experience so much better, but they choose not to.

Here's where the theme is with accessibility:

## Theming (Dark / Light)

This is good. I improved a little on the default way the theme managed
both light and dark styles.

## Theming (Font)

I'll have a font selector to switch configurable text to Open Dyslexic
on demand. This helps people with dyslexia immensely, as it's much harder
to mix up characters when reading, and allows us to read faster.

## Proper Labels & Hiding

Work needs done here. The theme isn't yet reader friendly because the 
structure of the DOM itself just recently settled. 

## Tab Indexes / Keyboard Shortcuts

This is completely lacking and needs to be implemented

## Motion Reduction

This is done, just permanently off for most things. If you look at Infima
you'll see more available transitions and you can enable them by setting 
longer times in `src/_includes/css/theme.css`. 

I personally don't like motion at all (I have a traumatic brain injury), 
so I'm not going to maintain transition-rich things.

## Responsiveness

We're doing really good here, for the most part. Always room for improvement,
though, but perhaps that's effort spent on more lacking things.
