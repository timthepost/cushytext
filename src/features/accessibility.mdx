# {title}

If the user can't comfortably enjoy what we write, what's the point of 
all of this? It's important to be responsive, so that content is available
on any screen, and it's important for people to be able to use the site in 
a way that works for them.

Here's what this theme does to try and accomplish those goals:

## Light And Dark Color Schemes

The site has comfortable light and dark themes and looks for the user's preferences
when deciding which to show initially. Clicking on the switcher creates a persistent
preference setting in local storage.

## Font Selection

Clicking on the encircled `D` next to the theme switcher loads the 
<a href="https://opendyslexic.org/" target="_blank">OpenDyslexic</a> font for any long-form, 
non-UI text. I plan to apply it to additional elements once I'm sure DOM shaking isn't a 
problem with the introduction.

## Motion Reduction

Infima has the capability of _considerably_ more animation and effects; these have been 
turned down to a minimum by default. You can add this back in the `style.css` override 
file.

## Responsiveness

This theme is fully-responsive and aims to stay that way. Infima's grid system and baked-in
responsive architecture with responsive components makes this easy to maintain.

## We Need To Do Better With:

Labels, tab navigation, keyboard shortcuts. We need this too, and it's on the roadmap.
