Things that need done before the first release:

# everywhere

- Code highlighting isn't working with MDX/SSX yet. I expect this to 
  be fixed before Lume3 comes out (it's Lume that has to change it)

# blog

- It's not possible to pipe through 'mdx' in lume filters, just 'md', 
  so excerpts may contain unparsed JSX. Not much I can do about that yet.

- TOC plugin for Lume currently does not work with MDX. Need to use one 
  of the remark plugins, or make one.

- Blog needs actual container / image styles (currently has an image
  helper you have to use manually)

- Pagination / next & prev links / breadcrumbs

- Archive & tag pages

# documentation

 - Prev / Next links, breadcrumbs.

 - Show page tags and links, but no "docs" archive or tag pages.

# tags

 - Need components to handle tags. We also have special archetype tags
   that have to be filtered out of views and templates aren't the place
   to do that. Not a bug yet but will be as soon as tags break because
   they're hard coded.

# nav

 - I hope to see nav become more componentized. Right now there's code that
   fills the sidebars automatically, and the archives and stuff, and the 
   top nav, but it's all separate code. Not really a bug, it just bothers 
   me a bit how it is.

# search 

 - To launch, we can just open a modal when someone clicks on the search 
   bar and just use the pagefind UI. 

 - BUT, we need that nav search bar working ajax as-they-type calling middleware
   which uses the pagefind API plus lume's search helpers + tag filtering.

# documentation and content 

 - Many of the site pages are unfinished or missing.

 - Tidy up / spritz up the index page

 # plugins

  - og image generator, sitemap, rss / JSON, minifier, compression, JS optimization,
    links, (others?)
